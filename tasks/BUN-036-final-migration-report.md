# BUN-036: Final Migration Report

## Objective

Summarize the Node-to-Bun migration and verify whether the practical goal was achieved: lower memory usage and a lighter runtime for small installations.

## Context

Without a final report, it will be unclear which changes mattered and which only rearranged dependencies.

## Scope

- Collect results for:
  - Node baseline;
  - Bun compatibility phase;
  - native Bun hot paths;
  - lightweight Docker.
- Compare:
  - cold-start RSS;
  - RSS after 10 minutes with 20 monitors;
  - startup time;
  - dependency count;
  - Docker image size.
- List removed dependencies.
- List dependencies intentionally kept.
- Identify remaining major costs.

## Out of Scope

- New optimizations.
- Rewriting the application.
- Declaring a stable release.

## Suggested Implementation

1. Add `docs/perf/final-bun-migration-report.md`.
2. Gather all reports from `docs/perf/`.
3. Add comparison tables.
4. Add a section for the changes that had the largest impact.
5. Add a section for what remains and why.
6. Add recommended next work.

## Files to Inspect

- `docs/perf/`
- `tasks/`
- `package.json`
- `README.md`
- `docker/dockerfile`

## Validation

```bash
bun run bun:check
bun run bench:memory:bun
docker image ls | rg "uptime-buna"
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Final report exists.
- Report includes numeric Node vs Bun comparison.
- Report includes RSS for the 20-monitor scenario.
- Report includes dependency count and Docker image size.
- Report states whether the original memory goal was reached.
- Report lists remaining limitations plainly.

## Completion Evidence

Link to the report and state the outcome in one sentence: memory goal reached or not reached, with RSS value.
